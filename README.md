# Image Caption Editor

![Screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

Made this because I wanted to have a way to look at images captioned for learning in Stable Diffusion. </br></br>
Lists images found in browsed folder, displays pictures, and then displays the txt file with the same name under it. </br></br>
Made with GPT-4 in ChatGPT. Tried to optimize and improve UX as best as I could but I do not actually know how to code, so feel free to edit it.
